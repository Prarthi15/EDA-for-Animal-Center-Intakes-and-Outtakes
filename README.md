# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing animal intake and outcome data to identify trends and patterns. The data is cleaned and visualized to extract meaningful insights that could help the animal center in better managing their operations.

# Data Files
DataSet_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv: Separate data of animal intakes.
DataSet_Animal_Center_Outcomes.csv: Separate data of animal outcomes.

# Tasks
Task 1: Data Shape
Description: Display the shape (number of rows and columns) of the intake and outcomes datasets.
Result:
Intake Data: (N, M)
Outcomes Data: (N, M)

Task 2: Identifying Null Values
Description: Identify columns with null values in both the intake and outcomes datasets.
Result: Lists of columns with null values in both datasets.

Task 3: Removing Duplicates
Description: Remove duplicate rows from the intake dataset.
Result: Display the shape of the intake dataset before and after removing duplicates.

Task 4: Renaming Columns
Description: Rename columns in the intake dataset to make them more user-friendly.
Result: Updated column names.

Task 5: Removing Redundant Columns
Description: Remove the 'MonthYear' column from both the intake and outcomes datasets as it is similar to the 'DateTime' column.
Result: Updated datasets without the 'MonthYear' column.

Task 6: Extracting Date Components
Description: Extract month and year from the 'DateTime' column in both datasets.
Result: Additional columns for month and year in both datasets.

Task 7: Yearly Intake Analysis
Description: Identify which month and year had the most animal intakes. Create a pie chart representing year-wise animal intake from 2014 to 2021.
Result:
Year with the most intakes identified.
Pie chart visualization.

Task 8: Monthly Intake Analysis
Description: Create a bar chart to represent month-wise animal intake and identify the month with the highest animal intake.
Result:
Month with the highest intakes identified.
Bar chart visualization.
